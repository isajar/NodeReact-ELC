## TASK

You are required to create a simple auto-search feature similar to [this one](https://www.maccosmetics.com/) where-by, as you type, the data is checked against a Node server and the response is then loaded in with React. You can style this however you wish and can implement it however you wish but you MUST use React and Node to accomplish this. This has already been setup for you in the source code provided. Some general tips on starting:

### NOTES

1. At first I couldnt run the server because of my node version (v14.15.4) and some incompatibilities. I solve it with this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55921442/how-to-fix-referenceerror-primordials-is-not-defined-in-node

2. This is my first contact with React. I am an Angular Developer so I try to do my best to tackle the challenge.
